# template-engine

## Description 

This project was created to generate an engineering team using a CLI. Unique data is gathered about each team member (manager, engineer, 
and/or intern) and then an HTML page is dynamically generated based on the information gathered.

The biggest challenge I faced was figuring out how to generate each team member and then regather that information to be put into an HTML page.
I eventually created an array to pass the information to render the team page.  Future edits to this program could be to add additional employee
options and further employee information.  

## Installation

To utilize the project install inquirer (and jest if you would like to run tests)

## Usage 

Create an engineering team using a command line application. Once all the information is gathered an HTML page is created that showcases
all of the teams information.
